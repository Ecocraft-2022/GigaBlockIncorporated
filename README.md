<div id="introduction"/>

## **GigaBlockIncorporated - Ecocraft**
The main purpose of this plugin is to broaden the general knowledge on pollution and its negative impacts. We decided to show how pollution affects certain areas of the word so this plugin is mended to be played on a map that resembles earth such as maps found [here](https://earth.motfe.net/map-downloads/). In plugin showcase we decided to use maps in scale 1:1000. We also used the open source [api](https://aqicn.org/) to retrieve pollution information from different parts of the world.

<div id="pollution"/>

## **Pollution**

This feature is supposed to show how pollution affects everything around us, and how strongly we affect the environment and the other way. The core principle underlying pollution are [regions] (#regions). Every region has certain attributes. In this section, we will focus on [global] (#global-pollution) and [local] (#local-pollution) pollution.The pollution accounted for is **overallpollution** - the sum of local and global pollution. There are three levels of pollution - low pollution (has no negative effects), moderate pollution (has certain negative effects) and high pollution (has revolutionary effects). Look at [this] (#pollution-effects) for further information about pollution effects.

<div id="global-pollution"/>

## **Global Pollution**

Global Pollution is fetched from API, and it cannot be changed by player - it's the base pollution level for given [region] (#regions). Global pollution value is the value from the station situated in nearest [regions] (#regions) centre so its actual value may be offset or does not match with actual Geo location.

<div id="local-pollution"/>




Local Pollution is calculated on certain events - when player plants a tree, when player changes a region, and when furance is burning. Local pollution can be changed by the player it can be [increased](#increase-pollution) and [decreased](#decrease-pollution) by certain player actions. Players should control pollution level because it can affect them. It can by negative thus it can lover pollution level in region below base value.

<div id="pollution-bar"/>

## **Pollution Indicator**
It is the main (other way -> [click](#c-details)) way of indication how polluted is current [region](#regions). Pollution indicator takes form of status bar with pollution number in center top of the screen.

There are three main indications:

* **Low Pollution** 
 <br/>

![low_pollution](./photos/lowPollution.png "Low_Pollution")

* **Medium Pollution** 

 <br/>

![medium_pollution](./photos/mediumPollution.png "Medium_Pollution")

* **High Pollution** 

 <br/>

![high_pollution](./photos/highPollution.png "High_Pollution")

Look at [this](#pollution-effects) for further information about pollution effects.

<div id="player-influence"/>

## **Player Influence on pollution**

By performing certain action player can decrease or increase level of local pollution. 

<div id="increase-pollution"/>

## **Increase Pollution**
Player can increase local pollution level by burning fossil fuels in furnaces or by braking saplings. When fossil fuel is burnt in the furnace cloud of pollution appears. When burning stops pollution level does not decrease. 

![furnace](./photos/furnace_burn.png "Furnace")

<div id="decrease-pollution"/>

## **Decrease Pollution**
You can decrease pollution level by either planting sapling or placing [solar panels](#solar-panel).

![solar_sap](./photos/solat_sapling.png "solar_sap")

<div id="pollution-effects"/>

There are no positive pollution effects. The upper bound of low, medium and high pollution can be changed in [configuration file](#configuration-file). When pollution in low there are no negative effects, when pollution is medium there are some negative effects ([acid rain](#acid-rain)) and when pollution is high there are plenty of negative effects ([acid rain](#acid-rain), [pollution damage](#pollution-damage), [no drop from crops](#no-drop-form-crops) and [dead fish in reservoirs](#dead-fish)).<div id="pollution-effects"/>

## **Acid Rain**
This effect appears when pollution level is medium or higher.Acid rain takes place of normal rain.It destroys leafs,grass, and crops. It also damages living creatures including player. Damage vary from level. Damage values and pollution boundires can be set in [configuration file]("#configuration-file).
<div id="pollution-damage"/>

## **Pollution Damage**
This effect appears only when pollution level is high. When player is in highly polluted [region](#region) it is harming him constantly in time intervals. Damage value and interval can be set in [configuration file](#configuration-file).

<div id="no-drop-form-crops"/>

## **No drop from crops**
This effect appears only when pollution level is high. When player is in highly polluted [region](#region) the is a 50% chance that crops would not drop an item.


<div id="dead-fish"/>

## **Dead fish in reservoirs**
This effect appears only when pollution level is high. When player is in highly polluted [region](#region) the fishes that player caught will be dead. When player eat dead fish he will be given negative effects. Same thing happen when player cook dead fish and eat it.

![dead_fish](/photos/dead_fish.png)

<div id="mask"/>

## **Mask**
This is the countermeasure to [pollution damage](#pollution-damage). When player wears a mask he would not take damage even when in highly polluted region.

![mask](photos/mask.png)

<div id="solar-panel-h"/>

## **Photovoltaic installation**
Photovoltaic installation is an alternative way of smelting in furnaces, without producing any pollution at all. To make photovoltaic installation you have to have [cable](#cable), [solar panel base](#solar-panel-base) and [solar panel](#solar-panel). [solar panel](#solar-panel) must be placed on [photovoltaic panel base](#solar-panel-base) and when the criteria are fulfilled (there is a day, solar panel is not obscured) installation will be producing power. To connet furnaces use [cable](#cable).

![instalation](/photos/instalation.png)

<div id="solar-panel"/>

## **Solar panel**
It is the source of energy in [photovoltaic installation] (#solar-panel-h). To obtain this block use either [. /solar] (#c-solar) command or use [crafting] (#cr-solar-panel) recipe.
<br/>

![panel](photos/panel.png)
<div id="solar-panel-base"/>

## **Solar panel base**
This block is required to transport energy from photovoltaic panel to cable. To obtain this block use either [./solarbase](#c-solar-panel-base) command od use [crafting](#cr-solar-panel-base) recipe. 
<br/>

![base](photos/base.png)

<div id="cable"/>

## **Cable**
This block is required to transport energy from photovoltaic panel base to furnace. To obtain this block use either [./cable](#c-cable) command od use [crafting](#cr-cable) recipe. 
<br/>
![base](photos/cable.png)


<div id="regions"/>

## **Regions**
Region is base on which pollution system is build. In [configuration file](#configuration-file) you have to input world dimensions (width and height) after that you have to enter number of regions that the world will be deviled - setting the default resolution (higher the number of region the better resolution).

<div id="word-map"/>

## **Use of world map**
Our plugin use word map influence to more immersion. Thanks to that player can play for eg. in their home country and experience how polluted is this area.

<div id="geo-location"/>

## **Data from geo-location**
The reason behind entering word dimensions is that it enable us to calculate in-game coordinates into real life coordinates and thanks to that we can implement [global pollution](#global-pollution) (api that we use require coordinates) and [/realTp](#c-realTp) command.

<div id="heat-islands"/>

## **Heat Islands**

Heat islands are urbanized areas that experience higher temperatures than outlying areas. This is caused by structures such as buildings, roads and other infrastructure absorb energy from sun an then re-emit it in form of heat. In our implantation we replaced this behavior. We categorized some blocks as heat absorbing (for example concrete). When players is standing to on heat absorbing block he starts to take damage (only when he does not wear armor on his feet).

<br/>

![cable_crafting](./photos/cable_c.png)

<div id="texture-pack"/>

## **Texture Packe**

The texture pack is mostly based on noteblocks. This particular block has the most states. This property us to make the custom blocks used in our plugin, such as [cable](#cable),[Solar panel](#solar-panel) and [Solar panel base](#solar-panel-base). It also introduces the fiery screen, visible during the [heat island](#heat-islands) phenomenon and [face mask](#face-mask), which can be worn by the player.

<div id="configuration-file"/>

## **Configuration File**
Configuration file (config. yml) is located in the plugin folder (EcoCraft) inside the plugin folder located in server files. 
<br/>
In configuration file you declare the base values required for plugin to work.
<br/>

The most important one are world *dimensions*, *number of regions*

![worldDim](./photos/world_dim.png)
<br/>

 and *api token*
 <br/>

![apiToken](./photos/apiToken.png)
 <br/>
  width and height of the map, if they are wrong coordinates will be calculated wrong, thus breaking pollution system and without API token data will not be fetched from API.
  <br/>

   Next values that can be chnged are *pollution boundaries* and *acid rain damage* those values are optional and set do default vales.
   
  
<br/>

![pollutionValues](./photos/pollution-config.png)

<br/>

 Also *showcase mode* is optioanl. This mode gives admin reserved commands (implemented in [commands](#commands) to everyone.
<br/>
<div id="instalation"/>

## **Installation**
First, you have to download [earth map] (https://earth.motfe.net/map-downloads/) and replace your *world* folder with it. To install the plugin you have to build a jar file inside the plugin folder located in your server file. Next, you have to make changes to [configuration file] (#configuration-file) (input width, height, API token and number of regions).
